# sslscan
Python code for mass scanning IP ranges for certificates

Stores inside a sqlite database and allows for you to query the database in SQL like string format such as:

%aws%

Code is related to a BSides springfield 2018 presentation I did with Joshua Platt regarding tracking malware backends by server profiling.
